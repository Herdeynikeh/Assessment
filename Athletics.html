      Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running,
      jumping, throwing, and walking.[1] The most common types of athletics
      competitions are track and field, <br>
      road running, cross country running, and racewalking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time,
      where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that
      achieves the highest or furthest <br>
      measurement from a series of attempts. The simplicity of the competitions,
      and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the
      most common types of sports <br>
      in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception
      of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a
      team score, such as cross country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776
      BC. The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in
      Western Europe and North <br>
      America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other
      parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are held under the
      auspices of World Athletics, <br>
      the global governing body for the sport of athletics, or its member
      continental and national federations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics. The
      foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics
      Championships, which incorporates track and <br>
      field, marathon running and race walking. Other top level competitions in
      athletics include the World Athletics Cross Country Championships and the
      World Half Marathon Championships. <br>
      Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and
      the World Para Athletics Championships.
